## Vulnerability Remediation Requirements for Internet-Accessible Systems

This page contains a web-friendly version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's [Binding Operational Directive 19-02]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/report/bod-19-02.pdf), “_Vulnerability Remediation Requirements for Internet-Accessible Systems_”.

*A binding operational directive is a [compulsory direction](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3552%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3552)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to federal, executive branch, departments and agencies for purposes of safeguarding federal information and information systems.*

*[Section 3553(b)(2) of title 44, U.S. Code](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title44-section3553&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjQ0IHNlY3Rpb246MzU1MiBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSkgT1IgKGdyYW51bGVpZDpVU0MtcHJlbGltLXRpdGxlNDQtc2VjdGlvbjM1NTIp%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim), authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and oversee the implementation of binding operational directives.*

*Federal agencies are [required](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3554%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3554)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to comply with DHS-developed directives.*

*These directives [do not apply](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3553%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3553)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to statutorily defined "national security systems" nor to certain systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community.*

### Background
As federal agencies continue to expand their Internet presence through
increased deployment of Internet-accessible systems, and operate
interconnected and complex systems, it is more critical than ever for
federal agencies to rapidly remediate vulnerabilities that otherwise
could allow malicious actors to compromise federal networks through
exploitable, externally-facing systems. Recent reports from government
and industry partners indicate that the average time between discovery
and exploitation of a vulnerability is decreasing as today's adversaries
are more skilled, persistent, and able to exploit known vulnerabilities.
The federal government must continue to take deliberate steps to reduce
the overall attack surface and minimize the risk of unauthorized access
to federal information systems as soon as possible.

[Binding Operational Directive 15-01]({{ site.baseurl }}/bod/15-01/): *Critical Vulnerability Mitigation
Requirement for Federal Civilian Executive Branch Departments and
Agencies' Internet-Accessible Systems*[^1] established requirements for
federal agencies to review and remediate critical vulnerabilities on
Internet-facing systems identified by the National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) within 30 days of issuance of
their weekly Cyber Hygiene report. Since its issuance in 2015, the prior
National Protection and Programs Directorate and the current
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) oversaw a
substantial decrease in the number of critical vulnerabilities over 30
calendar days and a significant improvement in how agency teams
identified and responded to these vulnerabilities in a timely manner. By
implementing specific remediation actions, and initiating ongoing
monitoring and transparent reporting via CISA's Cyber Hygiene
service,[^2] BOD 15-01 helped drive progress and enhance the federal
government's security posture. In support of BOD implementation, CISA
leverages Cyber Hygiene scanning results to identify cross-government
trends and persistent constraints, and works with the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) to help impacted agencies overcome technical
and resource challenges that prevent the rapid remediation of
vulnerabilities.

The federal government must continue to enhance our security posture,
reduce risks posed by vulnerable Internet-accessible systems, and build
upon the success of BOD 15-01 by advancing federal requirements for high
and critical vulnerability remediation to further reduce the attack
surface and risk to federal agency information systems.

### Revocation
This directive supersedes BOD 15-01, *Critical Vulnerability Mitigation
Requirement for Federal Civilian Executive Branch Departments and
Agencies' Internet-Accessible Systems* (May 21, 2015), which is hereby
revoked.

### Required Actions
To ensure effective and timely remediation of critical and high
vulnerabilities identified through Cyber Hygiene scanning, federal
agencies shall complete the following actions:

1.  **Ensure Access and Verify Scope**

    a.  Ensure Cyber Hygiene scanning access by removing Cyber Hygiene
        source IP addresses from block lists.

    b.  Within five working days of the
        change, notify CISA at <ncats@hq.dhs.gov> of any modifications
        to your agency's Internet-accessible IP addresses. This includes
        newly acquired Internet-accessible IP addresses or re-assigned
        Internet-accessible IP addresses that are no longer part of the
        agency's asset inventory.

    c.  Upon request from CISA, submit updated Cyber Hygiene agreements
        to ncats@hq.dhs.gov.

2.  **Review and Remediate Critical and High Vulnerabilities**

    a.  Review Cyber Hygiene reports issued by CISA and remediate the
        critical and high vulnerabilities detected on the agency's
        Internet-accessible systems as follows:

      * Critical vulnerabilities must be remediated _within 15 calendar
    days_ of initial detection.
      * High vulnerabilities must be remediated _within 30 calendar
    days_ of initial detection.

    b.  If vulnerabilities are not remediated within the specified
        timeframes, CISA will send a partially populated remediation
        plan identifying all overdue, in-scope vulnerabilities to the
        agency POCs for validation and population. Agencies shall return
        the completed remediation plan _within three working
        days_ of receipt to <fnr.bod@hq.dhs.gov>. The
        recipient of the remediation plan shall complete the following
        fields in the remediation plan:

      1.  Vulnerability remediation constraints
      2.  Interim mitigation actions to overcome constraints
      3.  Estimated completion date to remediate the vulnerability

### Progress Tracking
CISA will monitor federal agency progress and will engage agency senior
leadership, such as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief
Information Officer (CIO), and Senior Accountable Official for Risk
Management (SAORM), as necessary and appropriate, when the agency has
not met the Required Action deadlines specified above.

CISA also will track the remediation of critical and high
vulnerabilities through persistent Cyber Hygiene scanning and will
validate compliance with the BOD requirements through these reports.

### CISA Actions

-   CISA will provide regular reports to federal agencies on Cyber
    Hygiene scanning results and current status, and a Federal
    Enterprise 'scorecard' report to agency leadership.

-   CISA will provide standard remediation plan templates for federal
    agencies to populate if remediation efforts exceed required
    timeframes.

-   CISA will engage agency POCs to discuss agency status and provide
    technical expertise and guidance for the remediation of specific
    vulnerabilities, as requested and appropriate.

-   CISA will engage Agency CIOs, CISOs, and SAORMs throughout the
    escalation process, if necessary.

-   CISA will provide monthly Cyber Hygiene reports to OMB to
    identify cross-agency trends, persistent challenges, and facilitate
    potential policy and/or budget-related actions and remedies. The
    report will also ensure alignment with other OMB-led cybersecurity
    oversight initiatives.

#### When do the 15 and 30 day "clocks" start for remediation?
BOD 19-02 starts tracking vulnerabilities from the point of initial
detection, rather than the date of first report to agencies. To
facilitate tracking, the 'detection date' of each vulnerability is
included in the findings.csv attachment under appendix G within agency
Cyber Hygiene reports.

Empirical evidence from government and industry
continues to demonstrate the need to remediate significant
vulnerabilities closer to the time of detection. CISA encourages
agencies to use internal scanning capabilities to detect vulnerabilities
prior to the delivery of weekly Cyber Hygiene reports. CISA is exploring
the sending of alerts to agencies as vulnerabilities are discovered to
help bridge the gap between detection and notification.

#### When will CISA start including high severity vulnerabilities in agencies' reports?
In preparation for BOD 19-02, the Federal Cyber Exposure Scorecard
(FCES) to agency leadership started showing high vulnerability counts,
in addition to the critical vulnerability counts, in March 2019. CISA
will continue to scan for and report on vulnerabilities of all
severities (from low to critical) and include this information in
agencies' weekly Cyber Hygiene reports.

#### But aren't today's exploits to Internet-accessible devices measured in minutes and hours, not weeks?
Agencies are responsible for managing risk to their networks, and should
remediate vulnerabilities to critical systems as quickly as possible.
The 15 day requirement in the BOD is the latest agencies should
remediate all critical and high vulnerabilities to Internet-accessible
devices.

#### Why does BOD 19-02 treat all Internet-accessible devices equally and considers all critical and high vulnerabilities the same?
Agencies are responsible for managing cybersecurity risk in their
environments. CISA encourages agencies to apply additional parameters,
rules, and internal policy decision points which may affect the
acceptable timeframes to remediate specific types of vulnerabilities or
vulnerabilities to certain types of devices. CISA recommends configuring
patch management and vulnerability management programs to exceed BOD
19-02 requirements and to prioritize certain vulnerabilities and devices
over others as part of normal security operations.

#### Why is CISA requiring the return of completed remediation plans within three working days?
CISA expects agencies to begin formulating remediation strategies well
in advance of the 15 and 30 day deadlines, to accelerate remediation of
vulnerabilities and allow easy integration of remediation information
into plans for submittal to CISA once baselines are surpassed. CISA is
compensating for the short turn-around time by providing a mostly
pre-populated remediation plan for agency personnel to complete.
Agencies only need to complete the data fields for mitigation steps,
constraints, and estimated completion dates. This will ensure agencies
are reporting the correct vulnerabilities within remediation plans,
especially prior to changes introduced by the next week's Cyber Hygiene
reports.

#### What if there's a valid rationale for delaying remediation?
Please document the justification for delayed remediation in the
remediation plan provided by CISA (within the data column 'remediation
constraints'). CISA understands the distinctiveness of agency networks
and the dependences involved in vulnerability remediation and is willing
to work with agencies on a case-by-case basis when remediation is not
feasible within established timeframes. Within the remediation plan,
please be as descriptive as possible in detailing the justification for
the delay.

#### What's the process for resolving false positives?
To report a Cyber Hygiene-identified vulnerability as a false positive, please submit an email through your agency's POC to <ncats@hq.dhs.gov> (and cc: <fnr.bod@hq.dhs.gov>) with analysis and supporting evidence for determination (for example, a screenshot of the IP address and operating system). CISA will review your submission and perform necessary analysis to validate the assertion. This will not include exploiting a vulnerability, but may include actively sending packets to the host in question. CISA reserves the right to assert that findings are not false positives, but if CISA's analysis appears to confirm your agency's assertion, the vulnerability will be marked as a false positive.

Please utilize the False Positive Assertion form attached within your Cyber Hygiene report to organize your submission. The "cyber-hygiene-false-positive-assertion-form.pdf" attachment is located under Appendix G, and by clicking on the paper clip icon for the file. False positive status expires 365 days after designation by CISA and agencies are required to re-submit evidence on an annual basis to confirm the vulnerability remains a false positive. Vulnerabilities marked as 'false positives' will stop appearing in the main body of report for one year and will instead be reported in *Appendix E: False Positive Findings*, along with the expiration date of the false positive.

*Note: CISA acceptance of false positive assertions is not confirmation that a finding is indeed a false positive.*

#### Which version of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) does CISA use?
Cyber Hygiene leverages CVSS version 2, which is vulnerability scoring
system designed to provide a universally open and standardized method
for rating IT vulnerabilities. Agencies, where capable and practical,
should apply environmental scoring to Cyber Hygiene results as part of
the identification of critical and high vulnerabilities and adjust base
CVSS scores to be meaningful to their architectures, missions and
assets.

#### Where can I locate Cyber Hygiene's source IP addresses so my agency doesn't add them to block lists?
The website containing Cyber Hygiene's source IP addresses is included
within the Methodology section of agencies' weekly Cyber Hygiene reports
and can be provided to agencies upon request to ncats@hq.dhs.gov.
