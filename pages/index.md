The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) develops and oversees the implementation of binding operational directives pursuant to the [Federal
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=3) (FISMA).

A binding operational directive is a [compulsory direction](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=2) to federal executive branch departments and agencies for purposes of safeguarding federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk. FISMA [requires](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=6) federal agencies to comply with DHS-developed directives.

Binding operational directives [do not apply](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf#page=5) to statutorily defined "National Security Systems" nor to certain systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community.
